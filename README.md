Use QA instance to test and play around with code
Don't modify the Prod Instance, that's for production use only and we'll modify it together as a team during our meetings.

Inside QA, you should be able to access dashboard, login and survey folders each of which have a default.php file which is your index file to edit stuff.

If you edit and commit those to the GitHub repository, you should be able to access it on the live server.

For example, if you commited anything to the instance, go to the following links to view them:

<b>QA</b><br>
-> dashboard: https://jettrav.rishavkumar.io/qa/dashboard <br>
-> login: https://jettrav.rishavkumar.io/qa/login <br>
-> survey: https://jettrav.rishavkumar.io/qa/survey <be>

<b>Prod</b><br>
-> prod-instance: https://jettrav.rishavkumar.io/

Note that there is a .htaccess file in the local directory for this server. Don't modify this file, there is a rewrite engine configuration inside it that's serving our Prod instance to the main jettrav.rishavkumar.io domain name.
