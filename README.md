Jettrav Website Repo. Arizona State University Capstone 1 Project.

Use QA instance to test and play around with code
Don't modify the Prod Instance, that's for production use only and we'll modify it together as a team during our meetings.

Inside QA, you should be able to add any file you want within your own folder and access it on the domain. The GitHub repo is webhook-ed to the server to send all commits and pushes to the server directory for live testing.

If you edit and commit those to the GitHub repository, you should be able to access it on the live server.

For example, if you commited anything to the instance, go to the following links to view them:

<b>QA</b><br>
You can use QA instance within your own folders that have been assigned above.

<b>Prod</b><br>
-> prod-instance: https://jettrav.rishavkumar.io/ (Only for production use, mostly at the end of every sprint)

**htaccess removed for first development sprint**
Note that there is a .htaccess file in the local directory for this server. Don't modify this file, there is a rewrite engine configuration inside it that's serving our Prod instance to the main jettrav.rishavkumar.io domain name.
